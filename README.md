# Psychic-Game
OVERVIEW
In this assignment, students should create a Psychic Game. These app will run in the browser, and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

HOW TO PLAY
Player types ramdon letters on the key board in order to guess the letter the app ramdonly picked. 
Iniatilly the player has 10 chances to guess the letter. As the player type in letters, the wrong letters will be shown on the "guesses so far" and the guesses left will decrease.
When the player guess the ramdon letter, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).
When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).

WHAT WE SHOULD SEE ON THE SCREEN
Guess what letter I'm thinking of
Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)
Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)
Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)
Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)
